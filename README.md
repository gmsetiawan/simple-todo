This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

TanStack (formerly React Query) is a set of modern libraries designed to handle data fetching, caching, and synchronization in web applications. It is known for simplifying data management, especially for API requests. Here’s a beginner-friendly guide on using TanStack Query (TanStack Query is most commonly used, and it’s the heart of TanStack):

Why use TanStack Query?
Easy Data Fetching: It simplifies API requests with automatic caching, background updates, and re-fetching of stale data.
Optimistic Updates: Helps show instant results for user actions (like updating UI before server confirmation).
State Management: Reduces the need for complex state management for server data.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
